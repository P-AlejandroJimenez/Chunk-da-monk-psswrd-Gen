# Chunk-da-monk-psswrd-Gen

## Description

Motivation: The starter code presented an index.html file and a CSS file for a password generator. The javaScript file backing the functionality of the password generatior was left fairly sparce and required development.

Reason: I developed the password generator in order to learn how to construct a basic function to an existing webpage. To do this I used javaScript in conjuction with a index.html and a Csss file for the first time.

Content Learned: I learned how to structure a basic javaScript file and call a defined function within a parent function within that file. I also learned how to use a for loop on an array of arrays and math operation to generate random index's for a password.
